## About This Project

The goal of this project was to create a full-stack e-commerce application. It's built with a PostgreSQL database, Flask backend, and Jinja frontend styled with CSS. There was no requirement to hookup a payment system, so a user can add/remove items to/from their cart, but payment is not an option.

## Challenges 

This project offered a short timeline of less than 1 week, so I had to work efficiently to ensure it was completed on time. I was able to create functionality to sort and filter the products, but they don't work independently. A user must select an option from each section for them to work properly, something I plan to work on in the future.
